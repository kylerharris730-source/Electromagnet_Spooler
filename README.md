# Electromagnet Coil Spooler

A 3D-printed wire spooler designed for winding electromagnet and coil wire with consistent, even layers.  
The mechanism uses a sliding carriage and a mechanical direction-switching system.  

## Features

- **Dual-gear drive system**  
  Two gears spin in opposite directions. Only one is engaged at a time, depending on the lever position.

- **Sliding wire-guide carriage**  
  Holds the wire and moves smoothly across the spool as it winds.

- **Bistable magnetic detent (optional)**  
  Small magnets help hold the direction-switching lever in one of two stable positions. Improves feel and reduces accidental mid-travel switching.

- **Fully 3D-printed mechanism**  
  All motion components are printable; requires only a motor or hand-crank for the spool.

## How It Works

1. The spool rotates, driving the carriage via the gear train.  
2. The carriage moves in one direction until it reaches an end stop.  
3. You push the lever, disengaging the current gear and engaging the opposite-rotating gear.  
4. The carriage reverses direction and continues winding.  
5. This repeats, creating neat, even layers of wire.

## Printing Notes

- Recommended material: PLA or PETG  
- Use at least 20–30% infill for strength  
- Print gears with higher infill (40–60%)  
- No supports required for most parts depending on your slicer orientation

## Assembly

1. Print all parts.  
2. Insert bearings.  
3. Assemble the drive gears on their respective shafts.  
4. Install the direction-switching lever.  
5. Mount the carriage on the guide rails.  
6. Add optional magnets into the lever detent pockets.  
7. Attach your motor or hand-crank to the main drive shaft.  

## Usage

- Feed the magnet wire through the guide hole in the carriage.  
- Start turning the motor or crank.  
- The carriage will automatically sweep back and forth, laying the wire evenly.  
- Adjust spool width, gear ratio, or rail length in the CAD model if needed.
